## Installation

```

## Contributing

Please feel free to open a PR, but keep in mind this project's goals. This is meant to be a simple scroll view widget.

The code should be simple enough for users to quickly understand and modify for their own purposes.

Please keep PRs small and scoped to a single feature or fix.

## Planned features

- horizontal scroll, should be pretty simple.
- **MORE DOCS**
- _optional_ if there would be simple enough implementation I would consider adding scrollbars.
